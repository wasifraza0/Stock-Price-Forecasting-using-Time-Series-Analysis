# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This project aims to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network. The model is trained on historical stock market data and uses it to make predictions about future stock prices.

# Dependencies
Python 3.6 or higher
Tensorflow 2.0 or higher
Keras
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Data
The dataset used in this project can be found in the "data" directory. It contains historical stock prices for a particular stock, as well as trading volume and other financial information.

#Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine
Install the required dependencies
Run the "Stock_Price_Prediction_LSTM.ipynb" file using Google colab or Jupyter Notebook
The Model will be trained on the dataset and the results will be plotted for visualization
The trained model can be used for the prediction of the future stock prices
Results
The model was able to achieve an accuracy of X% on the test set. The results are plotted for visualization of the predictions.

#Limitations
This project is based on a particular stock, you can use the same model for other stocks by changing the dataset
The model only predicts future stock prices based on historical data, it does not take into account other factors such as news or market sentiment.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of LSTM for stock price prediction and can serve as a starting point for further research in this field.
